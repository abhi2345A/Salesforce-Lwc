# Life cycle hooks in Mounting Phase:

1) Constructor Method:

* It is invoked when the component instance is created.
* We have to call the super() inside this first.
* At this point, component properties won't be ready.
* To access the host element, use this.template.
* Method flows from parent to child.
* we can't access child elements in component body because they don't exist yet,
* Don't add attributes to the host element in the Constructor.
