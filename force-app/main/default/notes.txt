# Life cycle hooks in Mounting Phase:

1) Constructor Method:

* It is invoked when the component instance is created.
* We have to call the super() inside this first.
* At this point, component properties won't be ready.
* To access the host element, use this.template.
* Method flows from parent to child.
* we can't access child elements in component body because they don't exist yet,
* Don't add attributes to the host element in the Constructor.


2) Connected Callback:

* It is invoked when the component is inserted into the DOM.
* Method flows from parent to child.
* We can't access the child elements in the component body because they don't exist yet.
* We can access the host element with this.template.
* Use it for: initialisation tasks, such as fetch data, set up caches, or listen to events(Pub/Sub).
* Don't use it to change the state of the component, such as loading values or setting properties. Use getters/setters instead.

 3) Rendered Callback:

 * It is invoked when component rendering is completed.
 * It can fire more than once.
 * Method flows from child to parent.
 * When component re-renders, all the expressions used in the template are reevaluated.
 * Don't use it -  to change the state or update property of the component..
 * Don't update a wire adapter configuration object property in renderedCallback(), as it can result in an infinite loop.

 4) Disconnected Callback:

 * Fires when the component is removed from the DOM.
 * It flows from parent to child.
 * specific to LWC, it isn't from the custom elements specification.
